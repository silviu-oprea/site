            <p>
During this time, I was an engineer at two tech startups.
First, a software engineer at VisualDNA, a data science and management platform, where I worked on data aggregation and reporting using Scala and the Scalding interface to Hadoop.
After VisualDNA, I spent some time as a contractor. Next, I was an artificial intelligence engineer at TheySay, a startup providing text analytics services, where I used technologies such as Scala and MongoDB.
